# Udacity AB Testing Final Project
Udacity website has a new design and wants to improve userâ€™s experience. This project aims at evaluating whether this new design can be effective in production. The project will go through experiment design and analysis to collect statistical evidences to make a reasonable decision to launch this new design or not.

## 1. Metric Choice
List which metrics you will use as invariant metrics and evaluation metrics here. For each metric, explain both why you did or did not use it as an invariant metric and why you did or did not use it as an evaluation metric. Also, state what results you will look for in your evaluation metrics in order to launch the experiment.


## 2. Variability
List the standard deviation of each of your evaluation metrics. For each of your evaluation metrics, indicate whether you think the analytic estimate would be comparable to the the empirical variability, or whether you expect them to be different (in which case it might be worth doing an empirical estimate if there is time). Briefly give your reasoning in each case.


## 3. Sizing
### Number of Samples vs. Power
### Duration vs. Exposure

## 4. Sanity Checks

## 5. Effect Size Tests

## 6. Sign Tests

## 7. Results Summary

## 8. Recommendation
